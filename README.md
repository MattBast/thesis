# Thesis
This repo contains my final thesis project (currently in development) for my computer science degree. The aim is to build a web app that will visualise the output of the pattern mining program RMiner. The patterns are visualised by first performing a hierarchical cluster to organise the patterns. The clusters are then visualised as circles. Clicking a cluster will break it into its component clusters which are then visualised. You can keep doing this until you reach the bottom of the hierarchy and the raw patterns are displayed.

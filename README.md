# Thesis
This repo contains my final thesis project (currently in development) for my computer science degree. The aim is to build a web app that will visualise the output of the pattern mining program RMiner.

To use, select a linkage method (average usually creates the most interesting visual) and then select the file containg the pattern set using the file upload button. The process of visualising the file starts as soon as the file is selected.

This project use's node.js and express.js for its server side operations. Socket.io and jQuery are used to pass data between the client and server. d3.js is used to visualise the dataset.

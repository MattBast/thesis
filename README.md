# Thesis
This is my final thesis project for my computer science degree. The aim is to build a web app that will visualise the output of the pattern mining program RMiner.

To use, make sure you have downloaded node.js. Then navigate to the app folder in your terminal. Type "node server.js" to start the server. Then open a browser and navigate to localhost:8000/visual.html. If you have a file you want visualisig click the top option. If you already have a saved file, click the middle option. If you just want a demo and to use the sample file provided, click the bottom option.

This project use's node.js and express.js for its server side operations. Socket.io and jQuery are used to pass data between the client and server. d3.js is used to visualise the dataset. Sidr is used for the sidebars.
